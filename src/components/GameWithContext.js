//notes on game:
/* 
so the game will basically be a full client-side react app with state management and data persistence occurring in the browser

so at this top "app" lvl, need to set context, and then there are basically 2 parallel systems running to persist data, context that the app is doing, and then a mirror image of it is being passed to localstorage for when the user comes back to the website.
