# JavaScript Trivia

JavaScript can get weird. To name a few examples: 
* `NaN === NaN` is `false` 
* `.1 + .2 !== .3` is `true`

And that's only just the beginning. On the subject of JavaScript's weirdness, there countless YouTube <a href="https://youtu.be/LYFTGQuwlh8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">videos</a>, <a href="https://whatthefuck.is/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blogs</a>, and even a popular <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/understand-javascript/?LSNPUBID=EXclnL5BfX4&ranEAID=EXclnL5BfX4&ranMID=39197&ranSiteID=EXclnL5BfX4-XHO858MvhVA.vPekTDaHXw&utm_medium=udemyads&utm_source=aff-campaign" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Udemy course</a>.

Knowing the quirks of the language and is important for debugging your code, acing the job interview, and looking smart infront of all your developer friends. 

JavaScript Trivia is a [interactive trivia app](/play) for the Javascript language. There is also a [public API](/api/getting-started) where you can get the trivia questions for your own application. 


## Get Started
- [Play JavaScript Trivia](/play)
- [API Docs](/api)

## Data Sourcing & Project Inspiration
The data was sourced from from the awesome <a href="https://github.com/lydiahallie/javascript-questions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">javascript-questions</a> repo created by the awesome <a href="https://github.com/lydiahallie" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lydia Hallie</a>. Immense thanks to her and everyone who helped contribute to the javascript-questions project. Without their work, this project would only be a fraction of what it is. 

While the javascript-questions information is truly steller, it only lived in a Markdown file...until now. In order to create JavaScript Trivia, the data from javascript-questions was parsed and turned into <a href="https://github.com/bpmutter/js-trivia-api/tree/master/questions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JSON files</a>. The parsed data was used to create a [public API](/api), which was then used to create the [Play](/play) section of this website.
