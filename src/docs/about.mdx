### Thank You Lydia & Co!!
The data was sourced from from the awesome <a href="https://github.com/lydiahallie/javascript-questions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">javascript-questions</a> repo created by the awesome <a href="https://github.com/lydiahallie" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lydia Hallie</a>. Immense thanks to her and everyone who helped contribute to the javascript-questions project. Without their work, this project would only be a fraction of what it is.
